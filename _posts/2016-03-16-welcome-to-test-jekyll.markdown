## We all start somewhere

Hi! Welcome to my own little corner of the internet.  I'm still a very junior developer but I've bootstraped one Jekyll website already, you might have seen it at [RMcNeely.github.io](RMcNeely.github.io).  Yeah it was a good project to keep myself involved with Ruby and Rails but I certainly didn't learn as much from the process as I could have.  While I like the overall look of what I've created there were a few things that I wasn't thrilled about and would like to change. So with that in mind I've decided to start over again from scratch with this Test-Jekyll website.

This is the first post here, I'll be sure to make sure I include a screenshot of the initial state of things so that my progress will be visible to anyone visiting.  Right now I'm enrolled in the Learn Verified Program with The FlatIron School learning web development.  The way I see it maintianing this Test-Jekyll will allow me to blog about what I'm learning and practice my skills without touching my main website for the time being. I think eventually I would like to see this either merge with, or replace that one. For now though... I just need to figure out markdown and how to post this!
